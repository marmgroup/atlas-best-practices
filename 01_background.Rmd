# Background

Tracking individual movement has become a firmly established component of animal ecology, helped by the adoption of the movement ecology paradigm (Nathan et al. 2008; Holyoak et al. 2008) and the rapid proliferation of animal tracking technologies (Kays et al. 2015; Hussey et al. 2015). The animal tracking revolution has offered unprecedented insights into the causes and consequences of animal space-use, from the mechanisms behind collective behaviour (e.g. Strandburg-Peshkin et al. 2015), to how animal migrations engineer landscape level processes (Geremia et al. 2019).
