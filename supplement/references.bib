  abstract = {Because of the heterogeneity of natural landscapes, animals have to move through various types of areas that are more or less suitable with respect to their current needs. The locations of the profitable places actually used, which may be only a subset of the whole set of suitable areas available, are usually unknown, but can be inferred from movement analysis by assuming that these places correspond to the limited areas where the animals spend more time than elsewhere. Identifying these intensively used areas makes it possible, through subsequent analyses, to address both how they are distributed with respect to key habitat features, and the underlying behavioral mechanisms used to find these areas and capitalize on such habitats. We critically reviewed the few previously published methods to detect changes in movement behavior likely to occur when an animal enters a profitable place. As all of them appeared to be too narrowly tuned to specific situations, we designed a new, easy-to-use method based on the time spent in the vicinity of successive path locations. We used computer simulations to show that our method is both quite general and robust to noisy data.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Fine-scale tracking of animal movement is important to understand the proximate mechanisms of animal behaviour. While GPS tracking is an excellent tool for measuring animal movement, it often causes a trade-off between tag weight, cost and lifespan that limits its application to relatively large individuals, a small number of individuals or short tracking durations, respectively. The reverse-GPS system, ATLAS, uses lighter, cheaper tags that last long periods of time at the similar sampling frequencies to GPS. ATLAS provides a regional-scale alternative to global GPS-based tracking with which hundreds of relatively small-bodied species can be tracked simultaneously for long periods of time. Here, we test the accuracy and precision of an ATLAS system, using concurrent GPS measurements as a reference. To measure accuracy, we calculated the distance between ATLAS and GPS location estimates for a route (mobile test) and 16 fixed locations (stationary test) on the Griend mudflat, the Netherlands. This location is the focus of a large-scale ATLAS system in the Wadden Sea consisting of 26 receivers and covering 1326 km2 of intertidal region, with almost no physical obstacles for radio signals. ATLAS-derived location estimates differed on average 4.2 m from GPS-estimated stationary test sites and 5.7 m from GPS tracks taken whilst moving between them. Signals that were collected by more receiver stations were more accurate, although even 3-receiver localisations were comparable with GPS localisations (\textasciitilde 10 m difference). Higher receiver stations detected the tag at further distances. In conclusion, ATLAS provides an alternative to GPS for regional-scale animal movement studies by providing movement data of comparable spatial accuracy. The growing use of the ATLAS systems motivates further refinement of best-practice application, such as considering the height of receivers, their spatial arrangement, density and the movement mode of the study species (e.g., ground-dwelling or flying). {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Negative density-dependence is generally studied within a single trophic level, thereby neglecting its effect on higher trophic levels. The `functional response' couples a predator's intake rate to prey density. Most widespread is a type II functional response, where intake rate increases asymptotically with prey density; this predicts the highest predator densities at the highest prey densities. In one of the most stringent tests of this generality to date, we measured density and quality of bivalve prey (edible cockles Cerastoderma edule) across 50 km{$^2$} of mudflat, and simultaneously, with a novel time-of-arrival methodology, tracked their avian predators (red knots Calidris canutus). Because of negative density-dependence in the individual quality of cockles, the predicted energy intake rates of red knots declined at high prey densities (a type IV, rather than a type II functional response). Resource-selection modelling revealed that red knots indeed selected areas of intermediate cockle densities where energy intake rates were maximized given their phenotype-specific digestive constraints (as indicated by gizzard mass). Because negative density-dependence is common, we question the current consensus and suggest that predators commonly maximize their energy intake rates at intermediate prey densities. Prey density alone may thus poorly predict intake rates, carrying capacity and spatial distributions of predators.},

We developed a simple screening method that identifies locations arising from unrealistic movement patterns.

  abstract = {Animals regularly return to locations such as foraging patches, nests, dens, watering holes, or movement corridors, and these revisited locations are often sites of ecological significance. Analyzing the temporal and spatial pattern of revisitation can lead to important insights into the life history and ecology of populations. We introduce the R package `recurse' to calculate revisitations to locations in the movement trajectory or other locations for one or multiple individuals. The package also calculates metrics such as residence time and time between visits. It can be used to quantitatively identify frequently used sites (e.g. dens, nests, foraging locations), to examine patterns of revisitation and link them with covariates such as habitat features or climatic data, and to address conservation questions of interest about specific locations. We present an example application with movement trajectory data from a turkey vulture Cathartes aura during the breeding season and demonstrate analyzing recursions, specific locations, seasonal and daily temporal patterns, and visit timing. The `recurse' package should be of interest both to ecologists looking to analyze their movement data and to conservationists needing site-specific information for management and conservation actions.},

  abstract = {Space use strategies by foraging animals are often considered to be species-specific. However, similarity between conspecific strategies may also result from similar resource environments. Here, we revisit classic predictions of the relationships between the resource distribution and foragers' space use by tracking free-living foragers of a single species in two contrasting resource landscapes. At two main non-breeding areas along the East-Atlantic flyway (Wadden Sea, The Netherlands and Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania), we mapped prey distributions and derived resource landscapes in terms of the predicted intake rate of red knots (Calidris canutus), migratory molluscivore shorebirds. We tracked the foraging paths of 13 and 38 individual red knots at intervals of 1\,s over two and five weeks in the Wadden Sea and at Banc d'Arguin, respectively. Mediated by competition for resources, we expected aggregation to be strong and site fidelity weak in an environment with large resource patches. The opposite was expected for small resource patches, but only if local resource abundances were high. Compared with Banc d'Arguin, resource patches in the Wadden Sea were larger and the maximum local resource abundance was higher. However, because of constraints set by digestive capacity, the average potential intake rates by red knots were similar at the two study sites. Space-use patterns differed as predicted from these differences in resource landscapes. Whereas foraging red knots in the Wadden Sea roamed the mudflats in high aggregation without site fidelity (i.e. grouping nomads), at Banc d'Arguin they showed less aggregation but were strongly site-faithful (i.e. solitary residents). The space use pattern of red knots in the two study areas showed diametrically opposite patterns. These differences could be explained from the distribution of resources in the two areas. Our findings imply that intraspecific similarities in space use patterns represent responses to similar resource environments rather than species-specificity. To predict how environmental change affects space use, we need to understand the degree to which space-use strategies result from developmental plasticity and behavioural flexibility. This requires not only tracking foragers throughout their development, but also tracking their environment in sufficient spatial and temporal detail.},

We describe the system in detail and show that it produces accurate location estimates in real settings and over long periods of time. Localization errors of wild animals carrying our transmitters have standard deviation of about 5m and mean of 5-15m. If we restrict the system to operate in the center of the receiver's band-pass filters, the mean error drops to about 5m. We also show how to reliably quantify the error in each individual location estimate. In addition to the characterization of accuracy, we introduce three technical innovations in the system. First, a method to model the error of individual time-of- arrival measurements, enabling correct weighing of the data to estimate locations and allowing estimation of the covariance matrix of each location estimate. Second, extensive use of known- position beacon transmitters, to synchronize the clocks of receivers (radio-frequency TOA localization require accurate clocks), to characterize and continuously monitor the performance of the system, and to model arrival- time-estimation errors. Third, we estimate the covariance matrix of each localization.},
