  abstract = {Management and conservation of populations of animals requires information on where they are, why they are there, and where else they could be. These objectives are typically approached by collecting data on the animals' use of space, relating these positional data to prevailing environmental conditions and employing the resulting statistical models to predict usage at other geographical regions. Technical advances in wildlife telemetry have accomplished manifold increases in the amount and quality of available data, creating the need for a statistical framework that can use them to make population-level inferences for habitat preference and space-use. This has been slow-in-coming because wildlife telemetry data are spatio-temporally autocorrelated, often unbalanced, presence-only observations of behaviourally complex animals, responding to a multitude of cross-correlated environmental variables. We review the evolution of regression models for the analysis of space-use and habitat preference and outline the essential features of a framework that emerges naturally from these foundations. This allows us to derive a relationship between usage of points in geographical space and preference of habitats in environmental space. Within this framework, we discuss eight challenges, inherent in the spatial analysis of telemetry data and, for each, we propose solutions that can work in tandem. Specifically, we propose a logistic, mixed-effects approach that uses generalized additive transformations of the environmental covariates and is fitted to a response data-set comprising the telemetry and simulated observations, under a case-control design. We apply this framework to a non-trivial case-study using satellite-tagged grey seals Halichoerus grypus from the east coast of Scotland. We perform model selection by cross-validation and confront our final model's predictions with telemetry data from the same, as well as different, geographical regions. We conclude that, despite the complex behaviour of the study species, flexible empirical models can capture the environmental relationships that shape population distributions.},

However, a theoretical framework to understand when and where resource tracking should occur, and how resource tracking should lead to emergent ecological patterns, is lacking. We present a framework that unites concepts from optimal foraging theory and landscape ecology, which can be used to generate and test predictions on how resource dynamics shape animal movement across taxa, systems, and scales.

  abstract = {Recent advances in tracking systems have revolutionized our ability to study animal movement in the wild. In aquatic environments, high-resolution acoustic telemetry systems make it technically possible to simultaneously monitor large amounts of individuals at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions, providing a unique opportunity to study the behaviour and social interactions using a reality mining approach. Despite the potential, high-resolution telemetry systems have had very limited use in coastal marine areas due to the limitations that these environments pose to the transmission of acoustic signals. This study aims at designing and testing a high-resolution acoustic telemetry system to monitor, for the first time, a natural fish population in an open marine area. First, we conducted preliminary range tests and a computer simulation study to identify the optimal design of the telemetry system. Then, we performed a series of stationary and moving tests to characterize the performance of the system in terms of positioning efficiency and precision. Finally, we obtained a dataset corresponding to the movements of 170 concurrently tagged individuals to demonstrate the overall functioning of the system with a real study case of the behaviour of a small-bodied coastal species. Our results show that high-resolution acoustic telemetry systems efficiently generate positional data in marine systems, providing a precision of few meters, a temporal resolution of few seconds, and the possibility of tracking hundreds of individuals simultaneously. Data post-processing using a trajectory filter and movement models proved to be key to achieve a sub-meter positioning precision. The main limitation detected for our system was the restricted detection range, which was negatively affected by the stratification of the water column. Our work demonstrates that high-resolution acoustic telemetry systems are an effective method to monitor the movements of free-ranging individuals at the population level in coastal sites. By providing highly precise positioning estimates of large amounts of individuals, these systems represent a powerful tool to study key ecological processes regarding the social interactions of individuals, including social dynamics, collective movements, or responses to environmental perturbations, and to extend the studies to poorly studied small-sized species or life-stages.},

  abstract = {A resource selection function is a model of the likelihood that an available spatial unit will be used by an animal, given its resource value. But how do we appropriately define availability? Step selection analysis deals with this problem at the scale of the observed positional data, by matching each `used step' (connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal) with a set of `available steps' randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or their characteristics. Here we present a simple extension to this approach, termed integrated step selection analysis (iSSA), which relaxes the implicit assumption that observed movement attributes (i.e. velocities and their temporal autocorrelations) are independent of resource selection. Instead, iSSA relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource selection parameters, thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a mechanistic movement model. We provide theoretical underpinning of iSSA, as well as practical guidelines to its implementation. Using computer simulations, we evaluate the inferential and predictive capacity of iSSA compared to currently used methods. Our work demonstrates the utility of iSSA as a general, flexible and user-friendly approach for both evaluating a variety of ecological hypotheses, and predicting future ecological patterns.},

Here we present a novel positioning method called YAPS (Yet Another Positioning Solver), involving Maximum Likelihood analysis of a state-space model applied directly to time of arrival (TOA) data in combination with a movement model. YAPS avoids the sequential positioning-filtering-approach applied in alternative tools by using all available data in a single model, and offers better accuracy and error control. Feasibility and performance of YAPS was rigorously tested in a simulation study and by applying YAPS to data from an acoustic transmitter towed in a receiver array. Performance was compared to an alternative positioning model and proprietary software. The simulation study and field test revealed that YAPS performance was better and more consistent than alternatives. We conclude that YAPS outperformed the compared alternative methods, and that YAPS constitute a vast improvement to currently available positioning software in acoustic telemetry. Additionally, in contrast to vendor-supplied solutions, YAPS is transparent, flexible and can easily be adapted and extended for further improvements or to meet study specific requirements such as three-dimensional positioning.},

  abstract = {Mechanistic home range models are important tools in modeling animal dynamics in spatially complex environments. We introduce a class of stochastic models for animal movement in a habitat of varying preference. Such models interpolate between spatially implicit resource selection analysis (RSA) and advection-diffusion models, possessing these two models as limiting cases. We find a closed-form solution for the steady-state (equilibrium) probability distribution u* using a factorization of the redistribution operator into symmetric and diagonal parts. How space use is controlled by the habitat preference function w depends on the characteristic width of the animals' redistribution kernel: when the redistribution kernel is wide relative to variation in w, u* {$\propto$} w, whereas when it is narrow relative to variation in w, u* {$\propto$} w2. In addition, we analyze the behavior at discontinuities in w which occur at habitat type boundaries, and simulate the dynamics of space use given two-dimensional prey-availability data, exploring the effect of the redistribution kernel width. Our factorization allows such numerical simulations to be done extremely fast; we expect this to aid the computationally intensive task of model parameter fitting and inverse modeling.},

The locations of the profitable places actually used, which may be only a subset of the whole set of suitable areas available, are usually unknown, but can be inferred from movement analysis by assuming that these places correspond to the limited areas where the animals spend more time than elsewhere. Identifying these intensively used areas makes it possible, through subsequent analyses, to address both how they are distributed with respect to key habitat features, and the underlying behavioral mechanisms used to find these areas and capitalize on such habitats. We critically reviewed the few previously published methods to detect changes in movement behavior likely to occur when an animal enters a profitable place. As all of them appeared to be too narrowly tuned to specific situations, we designed a new, easy-to-use method based on the time spent in the vicinity of successive path locations. We used computer simulations to show that our method is both quite general and robust to noisy data.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Fine-scale tracking of animal movement is important to understand the proximate mechanisms of animal behaviour. While GPS tracking is an excellent tool for measuring animal movement, it often causes a trade-off between tag weight, cost and lifespan that limits its application to relatively large individuals, a small number of individuals or short tracking durations, respectively. The reverse-GPS system, ATLAS, uses lighter, cheaper tags that last long periods of time at the similar sampling frequencies to GPS. ATLAS provides a regional-scale alternative to global GPS-based tracking with which hundreds of relatively small-bodied species can be tracked simultaneously for long periods of time. Here, we test the accuracy and precision of an ATLAS system, using concurrent GPS measurements as a reference. To measure accuracy, we calculated the distance between ATLAS and GPS location estimates for a route (mobile test) and 16 fixed locations (stationary test) on the Griend mudflat, the Netherlands. This location is the focus of a large-scale ATLAS system in the Wadden Sea consisting of 26 receivers and covering 1326 km2 of intertidal region, with almost no physical obstacles for radio signals. ATLAS-derived location estimates differed on average 4.2 m from GPS-estimated stationary test sites and 5.7 m from GPS tracks taken whilst moving between them. Signals that were collected by more receiver stations were more accurate, although even 3-receiver localisations were comparable with GPS localisations (\textasciitilde 10 m difference). Higher receiver stations detected the tag at further distances. In conclusion, ATLAS provides an alternative to GPS for regional-scale animal movement studies by providing movement data of comparable spatial accuracy. The growing use of the ATLAS systems motivates further refinement of best-practice application, such as considering the height of receivers, their spatial arrangement, density and the movement mode of the study species (e.g., ground-dwelling or flying). {$<$}/p{$>$}},

The `functional response' couples a predator's intake rate to prey density. Most widespread is a type II functional response, where intake rate increases asymptotically with prey density; this predicts the highest predator densities at the highest prey densities. In one of the most stringent tests of this generality to date, we measured density and quality of bivalve prey (edible cockles Cerastoderma edule) across 50 km{$^2$} of mudflat, and simultaneously, with a novel time-of-arrival methodology, tracked their avian predators (red knots Calidris canutus). Because of negative density-dependence in the individual quality of cockles, the predicted energy intake rates of red knots declined at high prey densities (a type IV, rather than a type II functional response). Resource-selection modelling revealed that red knots indeed selected areas of intermediate cockle densities where energy intake rates were maximized given their phenotype-specific digestive constraints (as indicated by gizzard mass). Because negative density-dependence is common, we question the current consensus and suggest that predators commonly maximize their energy intake rates at intermediate prey densities. Prey density alone may thus poorly predict intake rates, carrying capacity and spatial distributions of predators.},

The package also calculates metrics such as residence time and time between visits. It can be used to quantitatively identify frequently used sites (e.g. dens, nests, foraging locations), to examine patterns of revisitation and link them with covariates such as habitat features or climatic data, and to address conservation questions of interest about specific locations.

We envision an exciting synergy between animal ecology and GPS-based radiotelemetry, as for other examples of new technologies stimulating rapid conceptual advances, where research opportunities have been paralleled by technical and analytical challenges. Animal positions provide the elemental unit of movement paths and show where individuals interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss how knowing where animals go can help scientists in their search for a mechanistic understanding of key concepts of animal ecology, including resource use, home range and dispersal, and population dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant future, intense sampling of movements coupled with detailed information on habitat features at a variety of scales will allow us to represent an animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the intimate relationship between behaviour and fitness. An extended use of these data over long periods of time and over large spatial scales can provide robust inferences for complex, multi-factorial phenomena, such as meta-analyses of the effects of climate change on animal behaviour and distribution.},

  abstract = {Movement ecology has developed rapidly over the past decade, driven by advances in tracking technology that have largely removed data limitations. Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized. Discrete-time correlated random walk models (CRW) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately, CRWs confound the sampling and movement processes. CRW parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling-independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore, CRWs cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets. Recent developments in modelling movement as a continuous-time stochastic process (CTSP) solve these problems, but the mathematical difficulty of using CTSPs has limited their adoption in ecology. To remove this roadblock, we introduce the ctmm package for the R statistical computing environment. ctmm implements all of the CTSPs currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non-Markovian maximum likelihood estimation. ctmm is built around a standard workflow that begins with visual diagnostics, proceeds to candidate model identification, and then to maximum likelihood fitting and AIC-based model selection. Once an accurate CTSP for the data has been fitted and selected, analyses that require such a model, such as quantifying home range areas via autocorrelated kernel density estimation or estimating occurrence distributions via time-series Kriging, can then be performed. We use a case study with African buffalo to demonstrate the capabilities of ctmm and highlight the steps of a typical CTSP movement analysis workflow.},

  abstract = {The Global Positioning System (GPS) has been increasingly used during the past decade to monitor the movements of free-ranging animals. This technology allows to automatically relocate fitted animals, which often results into a high-frequency sampling of their trajectory during the study period. However, depending on the objective of trajectory analysis, this study may quickly become difficult, due to the lack of well designed computer programs. For example, the trajectory may be built by several ``parts'' corresponding to different behaviours of the animal, and the aim of the analysis could be to identify the different parts, and thereby the different activities, based on the properties of the trajectory. This complex task needs to be performed into a flexible computing environment, to facilitate exploratory analysis of its properties. In this paper, we present a new class of object of the R software, the class ``ltraj'' included in the package adehabitat, allowing the analysis of animals' trajectories. We developed this class of data after an extensive review of the literature on the analysis of animal movements. This class of data facilitates the computation of descriptive parameters of the trajectory (such as the relative angles between successive moves, distance between successive relocations, etc.), graphical exploration of these parameters, as well a numerous tests and analyses developed in the literature (first passage time, trajectory partitioning, etc.). Finally, this package also contains numerous examples of animal trajectories, and a working example illustrating the use of the package.},

  abstract = {Animal-borne accelerometers have been used across more than 120 species to infer biologically significant information such as energy expenditure and broad behavioural categories. While the accelerometer's high sensitivity to movement and fast response times present the unprecedented opportunity to resolve fine-scale behaviour, leveraging this opportunity will require overcoming the challenge of developing general, automated methods to analyse the nonstationary signals generated by nonlinear processes governing erratic, impulsive movement characteristic of fine-scale behaviour. We address this issue by conceptualising fine-scale behaviour in terms of characteristic microevents: impulsive movements producing brief ({$<$}1 s) shock signals in accelerometer data. We propose a `seek-and-learn' approach: a novel microevent detection step first locates where shock signals occur (`seek') by searching for peaks in envelopes of acceleration data. Robust machine learning (`learn') employing meaningful features then separates microevents. We showcase the application of our method on tri-axial accelerometer data collected on 10 free-living meerkats Suricata suricatta for four fine-scale foraging behaviours \textendash{} searching for digging sites, one-armed digging, two-armed digging and head jerks during prey ingestion. Annotated videos served as groundtruth, and performance was benchmarked against that of a variety of classical machine learning approaches. Microevent identification ({$\mu$}EvId) with eight features in a three-node hierarchical classification scheme employing logistic regression at each node achieved a mean overall accuracy of {$>$}85\% during leave-one-individual-out cross-validation, and exceeded that of the best classical machine learning approach by 8.6\%. {$\mu$}EvId was found to be robust not only to inter-individual variation but also to large changes in model parameters. Our results show that microevents can be modelled as impulse responses of the animal body-and-sensor system. The microevent detection step retains only informative regions of the signal, which results in the selection of discriminative features that reflect biomechanical differences between microevents. Moving-window-based classical machine learning approaches lack this prefiltering step, and were found to be suboptimal for capturing the nonstationary dynamics of the recorded signals. The general, automated technique of {$\mu$}EvId, together with existing models that can identify broad behavioural categories, provides future studies with a powerful toolkit to exploit the full potential of accelerometers for animal behaviour recognition.},

  abstract = {Aim We examined the range contraction of 309 declining species of animals and plants to determine if the contraction dynamics better matched predictions based on the demographic characteristics of historical populations (demographic hypothesis) or based on the contagion-like spread of extinction forces (contagion hypothesis). Location Species included in the analysis came from all biogeographic regions. Methods We obtained range maps for 309 species from literature or through personal correspondence with authorities. Hypotheses were contrasted by examining the sequence of changes in the proportion (C) of the remnant range that fell within the central region of the historical range. Monte Carlo simulations and polynomial regressions were employed to examine changes in C during the process of range contraction. Results The results of the Monte Carlo simulations indicated that more species had observed range contractions consistent with the contagion hypothesis than expected by chance (z-score = 2.922, P = 0.002). The Monte Carlo analysis also indicated that the number of species whose observed range contractions were consistent with the demographic hypothesis was no greater than expected by chance (z-score = 0.337, P = 0.367). The results of the polynomial regression analysis for the two most common taxonomic groups (mammals and birds) and for all geographical regions (Australia, Africa, Eurasia, and North America) we examined also supported the contagion hypothesis. Main conclusions Most of the examined range contractions are consistent with the contagion hypothesis and that the most likely contagion is human related disturbance. These results have important implications for the conservation of endangered species.},

This set of tools ranges from transmitters that send their signals to receivers up to a few kilometers away to those that send data to orbiting satellites and, more frequently, to devices that log data. They enable researchers to document, for long uninterrupted periods, how undisturbed organisms interact with each other and their environment in real time. In spite of advances enabling the monitoring of many physiological and behavioural variables across a range of taxa of various sizes, these devices have yet to be embraced widely by the ecological community. Our review suggests that this technology has immense potential for research in basic and applied animal ecology. Efforts to incorporate biotelemetry into broader ecological research programs should yield novel information that has been challenging to collect historically from free-ranging animals in their natural environments. Examples of research that would benefit from biotelemetry include the assessment of animal responses to different anthropogenic perturbations and the development of life-time energy budgets.},

We deployed GPS radiocollars at fixed locations in mountainous terrain across a range of canopy cover and terrain conditions using nondifferentially corrected GPS data to test a hypothesis that these factors affect fix rates and location error in a predictable manner. Terrain did not affect fix rates in forest openings but interacted with canopy cover, resulting in lower fix rates as canopy cover increased. Horizontal differences between recorded locations and associated true locations were 5.9 m and 30.6 m, respectively, for 50\% and 95\% circular error probable (CEP). Absolute differences between recorded elevations and associated true elevations were 22.9 m and 54.6 m, respectively, for 50\% and 95\% CEP. We rejected time of day as an influence on fix rates and found that collar performance was a large potential source of error. We recommend that raw GPS radiotelemetry data be screened for collar malfunctions and impossible data (e.g., a location beyond the possible range of a study animal) prior to analysis. We suggest that error in GPS radiotelemetry data could be decreased by considering rejection of 2-dimensional fixes, but doing so could introduce additional biases and must be done with caution, if at all. Fix-rate bias may potentially be addressed with correction factors if predictable relationships between fix rates and environmental factors exist.},

  abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

Theory predicts that spatial and temporal scales should co-vary in most ecological processes and that the most limiting factors should drive habitat selection at coarse ecological scales, but be less influential at finer scales. Using detailed location data on roe deer Capreolus capreolus inhabiting the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, we investigated habitat selection at several spatial and temporal scales. We tested 1) whether time-varying patterns were governed by factors reported as having the largest effects on fitness, 2) whether the trade-off between forage and predation risks differed among spatial and temporal scales and 3) if spatial and temporal scales are positively associated. We analysed the variation in habitat selection within the landscape and within home ranges at monthly intervals, with respect to land-cover type and proxys of food and cover over seasonal and diurnal temporal scales. The fine-scale temporal variation follows a nycthemeral cycle linked to diurnal variation in human disturbance. The large-scale variation matches seasonal plant phenology, suggesting food resources being a greater limiting factor than lynx predation risk. The trade-off between selection for food and cover was similar on seasonal and diurnal scale. Habitat selection at the different scales may be the consequence of the temporal variation and predictability of the limiting factors as much as its association with fitness. The landscape of fear might have less importance at the studied scale of habitat selection than generally accepted because of the predator hunting strategy. Finally, seasonal variation in habitat selection was similar at the large and small spatial scales, which may arise because of the marked philopatry of roe deer. The difference is supposed to be greater for wider ranging herbivores.},

Distinguishing between these explanations is important, because functionally, they might have very different consequences. In the first case, the animals could benefit from the presence of conspecifics, whereas in the second and third, they often suffer from increased competition [3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Using novel miniature sensors, we recorded GPS tracks and audio of five species of bats, monitoring their movement and interactions with conspecifics, which could be inferred from the audio recordings. We examined the hypothesis that food distribution plays a key role in determining social foraging patterns [14, 15, 16]. Specifically, this hypothesis predicts that searching for an ephemeral resource (whose distribution in time or space is hard to predict) is more likely to favor social foraging [10, 13, 14, 15] than searching for a predictable resource. The movement and social interactions differed between bats foraging on ephemeral versus predictable resources. Ephemeral species changed foraging sites and showed large temporal variation nightly. They aggregated with conspecifics as was supported by playback experiments and computer simulations. In contrast, predictable species were never observed near conspecifics and showed high spatial fidelity to the same foraging sites over multiple nights. Our results suggest that resource (un)predictability influences the costs and benefits of social foraging.},

The positional accuracy and performance of the VPS was estimated on a stationary and a slow-moving coded transmitter, and on two free-swimming elasmobranch species. Mean positional accuracy ({$\pm$}SD) of VPS estimates from a stationary transmitter deployed at several locations within the receiver array was 2.64{$\pm$}2.32m. Positional error was significantly lower inside (2.13{$\pm$}1.31m) than outside the array (5.12{$\pm$}4.11m; p{$<$}0001). There were no significant differences in positional accuracy between stationary and moving tests (4.09{$\pm$}2.53m; p=0.067). Furthermore, home range estimates and movement parameters of two elasmobranch species tracked simultaneously with VPS and active tracking were statistically similar (p{$>$}0.05). Our results suggest that the positional accuracy of the VPS is comparable to active tracking; however, researchers must consider specific environmental and biological variables when using the VPS. Additionally, the number, layout and proximity of acoustic receivers and synchronizing transmitters can improve considerably the performance of the VPS. The VPS provides a more efficient, less expensive approach to study and quantify fine-scale, long-term movements and habitat use of multiple individuals simultaneously, with the potential for improving our understanding on ecological and behavioral population level processes in aquatic environments.},

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

  abstract = {Understanding animal movement is a key challenge in ecology and conservation biology. Relocation data often represent a complex mixture of different movement behaviors, and reliably decomposing this mix into its component parts is an unresolved problem in movement ecology. Traditional approaches, such as composite random walk models, require that the timescales characterizing the movement are all similar to the usually arbitrary data-sampling rate. Movement behaviors such as long-distance searching and fine-scale foraging, however, are often intermixed but operate on vastly different spatial and temporal scales. An approach that integrates the full sweep of movement behaviors across scales is currently lacking. Here we show how the semivariance function (SVF) of a stochastic movement process can both identify multiple movement modes and solve the sampling rate problem. We express a broad range of continuous-space, continuous-time stochastic movement models in terms of their SVFs, connect them to relocation data via variogram regression, and compare them using standard model selection techniques. We illustrate our approach using Mongolian gazelle relocation data and show that gazelle movement is characterized by ballistic foraging movements on a 6-h timescale, fast diffusive searching with a 10-week timescale, and asymptotic diffusion over longer timescales.},

Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efficient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more finely resolved. To remedy these flaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from first principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle's observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have significant impact on ecology and conservation biology.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Animal tracking data are being collected more frequently, in greater detail, and on smaller taxa than ever before. These data hold the promise to increase the relevance of animal movement for understanding ecological processes, but this potential will only be fully realized if their accompanying location error is properly addressed. Historically, coarsely-sampled movement data have proved invaluable for understanding large scale processes (e.g., home range, habitat selection, etc.), but modern fine-scale data promise to unlock far more ecological information. While location error can often be ignored in coarsely sampled data, fine-scale data require much more care, and tools to do this have been lacking. Current approaches to dealing with location error largely fall into two categories\textemdash either discarding the least accurate location estimates prior to analysis or simultaneously fitting movement and error parameters in a hidden-state model. Unfortunately, both of these approaches have serious flaws. Here, we provide a general framework to account for location error in the analysis of animal tracking data, so that their potential can be unlocked. We apply our error-model-selection framework to 190 GPS, cellular, and acoustic devices representing 27 models from 14 manufacturers. Collectively, these devices are used to track a wide range of animal species comprising birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals of different sizes and with different behaviors, in urban, suburban, and wild settings. Then, using empirical data on tracked individuals from multiple species, we provide an overview of modern, error-informed movement analyses, including continuous-time path reconstruction, home-range distribution, home-range overlap, speed and distance estimation. Adding to these techniques, we introduce new error-informed estimators for outlier detection and autocorrelation visualization. We furthermore demonstrate how error-informed analyses on calibrated tracking data can be necessary to ensure that estimates are accurate and insensitive to location error, and allow researchers to use all of their data. Because error-induced biases depend on so many factors\textemdash sampling schedule, movement characteristics, tracking device, habitat, etc.\textemdash differential bias can easily confound biological inference and lead researchers to draw false conclusions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {1 Compared to traditional radio-collars, global positioning system (GPS) collars provide finer spatial resolution and collect locations across a broader range of spatial and temporal conditions. However, data from GPS collars are biased because vegetation and terrain interfere with the satellite signals necessary to acquire a location. Analyses of habitat selection generally proceed without correcting for this known sampling bias. We documented the effects of bias in resource selection functions (RSF) and compared the effectiveness of two bias-correction techniques. 2 The effects of environmental conditions on the probability of a GPS collar collecting a location were modelled for three brands of collar using data collected in 24-h trials at 194 test locations. The best-supported model was used to create GPS-biased data from unbiased animal locations. These data were used to assess the effects of bias given data losses in the range of 10\textendash 40\% at both 1- and 6-h sampling intensities. We compared the sign, value and significance of coefficients derived using biased and unbiased data. 3 With 6-h locations we observed type II error rates of 30\textendash 40\% given as little as a 10\% data loss. Biased data also produced coefficients that were significantly more negative than unbiased estimates. Increasing the sampling intensity from 6- to 1-h locations eliminated type II errors but increased the magnitude of coefficient bias. No type I errors or changes in sign were observed. 4 We applied sample weighting and iterative simulation given a 30\% data loss. For a biased vegetation type, simulation reduced more type II errors than weighting, most probably because the original sample size was re-established. However, selection for areas near trails, which was influenced by a biased vegetation type, showed fewer type II errors after weighting existing animal locations than after simulation. Both techniques corrected 100\% and {$\geq$} 80\% of the biased coefficients at the 6- and 1-h sampling intensities, respectively. 5 Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that GPS error is predictable and biases the coefficients of resource selection models dependant upon the GPS sampling intensity and the level of data loss. We provide effective alternatives for correcting bias and discuss applying corrections under different sampling designs.},

Despite a certain degree of inherent imprecision and bias in GPS locations, little synthesis regarding the predominant causes of these errors, their implications for ecological analysis or solutions exists. Terrestrial deployments report 37 per cent or less non-random data loss and location precision 30 m or less on average, with canopy closure having the predominant effect, and animal behaviour interacting with local habitat conditions to affect errors in unpredictable ways. Home-range estimates appear generally robust to contemporary levels of location imprecision and bias, whereas movement paths and inferences of habitat selection may readily become misleading. There is a critical need for greater understanding of the additive or compounding effects of location imprecision, fix-rate bias, and, in the case of resource selection, map error on ecological insights. Technological advances will help, but at present analysts have a suite of ad hoc statistical corrections and modelling approaches available\textemdash tools that vary greatly in analytical complexity and utility. The success of these solutions depends critically on understanding the error-inducing mechanisms, and the biggest gap in our current understanding involves species-specific behavioural effects on GPS performance.},

Interactions between animals are reflected in patterns of joint space use, which are also dynamic.

Furthermore, linking temporal variation in interactions to covariates remains cumbersome. We propose a novel method for analyzing the dynamics of joint space use that permits straightforward incorporation of covariates. This method builds upon tools commonly used by researchers, including kernel density estimators, utilization distribution intersection metrics, and extensions of linear models.},

  abstract = {The movement paths of individuals over landscapes are basically represented by sequences of points (xi, yi) occurring at times ti. Theoretically, these points can be viewed as being generated by stochastic processes that in the simplest cases are Gaussian random walks on featureless landscapes. Generalizations have been made of walks that (i) take place on landscapes with features, (ii) have correlated distributions of velocity and direction of movement in each time interval, (iii) are L\'evy processes in which distance or waiting-time (time-between steps) distributions have infinite moments, or (iv) have paths bounded in space and time. We begin by demonstrating that rather mild truncations of fat-tailed step-size distributions have a dramatic effect on dispersion of organisms, where such truncations naturally arise in real walks of organisms bounded by space and, more generally, influenced by the interactions of physiological, behavioral, and ecological factors with landscape features. These generalizations permit not only increased realism and hence greater accuracy in constructing movement pathways, but also provide a biogeographically detailed epistemological framework for interpreting movement patterns in all organisms, whether tossed in the wind or willfully driven. We illustrate the utility of our framework by demonstrating how fission\textendash fusion herding behavior arises among individuals endeavoring to satisfy both nutritional and safety demands in heterogeneous environments. We conclude with a brief discussion of potential methods that can be used to solve the inverse problem of identifying putative causal factors driving movement behavior on known landscapes, leaving details to references in the literature.},

Furthermore, movement data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis (BCPA), a likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of significant structural changes. The BCPA is robust to gappiness and measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the analysis to a GPS movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile, and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the ARGOS tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement data, we suggest that the BCPA can eventually motivate the development of mechanistic behavioural models.},

Soaring-gliding birds use rising-air columns (thermals) to reduce energy expenditure allocated to flight. We offer a framework to evaluate thermal soaring performance and use GPS-tracking to study movements of Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus). Because the location and intensity of thermals are variable, we hypothesized that soaring performance would improve with experience and predicted that the performance of inexperienced individuals ({$<$}2 months) would be inferior to that of experienced ones ({$>$}5 years). No differences were found in body characteristics, climb rates under low wind shear and thermal selection, presumably due to vultures' tendency to forage in mixed-age groups. Adults, however, outperformed juveniles in their ability to adjust fine-scale movements under challenging conditions, as juveniles had lower climb rates under intermediate wind shear, particularly on the lee-side of thermal columns. Juveniles were also less efficient along the route both in terms of time and energy. The consequences of these handicaps are probably exacerbated if juveniles lag behind adults in finding and approaching food.},

  abstract = {Knowing their way around The presence of a cognitive map is essential to our ability to navigate through areas we know because it facilitates the use of spatial knowledge to derive new routes. Whether such maps exist in nonhuman animals has been debated, largely because of the difficulty of demonstrating qualifying components of the map outside of a laboratory. In two studies on Egyptian fruit bats, Harten et al. and Toledo et al. together show that this species's navigational strategies meet the requirements for the use of a cognitive map of their environment, confirming that this skill occurs outside of humans (see the Perspective by Fenton). Science, this issue p. 194, p. 188; see also p. 142 How animals navigate over large-scale environments remains a riddle. Specifically, it is debated whether animals have cognitive maps. The hallmark of map-based navigation is the ability to perform shortcuts, i.e., to move in direct but novel routes. When tracking an animal in the wild, it is extremely difficult to determine whether a movement is truly novel because the animal's past movement is unknown. We overcame this difficulty by continuously tracking wild fruit bat pups from their very first flight outdoors and over the first months of their lives. Bats performed truly original shortcuts, supporting the hypothesis that they can perform large-scale map-based navigation. We documented how young pups developed their visual-based map, exemplifying the importance of exploration and demonstrating interindividual differences. Egyptian fruit bats appear to use a cognitive map. Egyptian fruit bats appear to use a cognitive map.},

Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34\% focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement.},

  abstract = {Background Movement data are frequently collected using Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, but recorded GPS locations are subject to errors. While past studies have suggested methods to improve location accuracy, mechanistic movement models utilize distributions of turning angles and directional biases and these data present a new challenge in recognizing and reducing the effect of measurement error. Methods I collected locations from a stationary GPS collar, analyzed a probabilistic model and used Monte Carlo simulations to understand how measurement error affects measured turning angles and directional biases. Results Results from each of the three methods were in complete agreement: measurement error gives rise to a systematic bias where a stationary animal is most likely to be measured as turning 180\textdegree{} or moving towards a fixed point in space. These spurious effects occur in GPS data when the measured distance between locations is {$<$}20 meters. Conclusions Measurement error must be considered as a possible cause of 180\textdegree{} turning angles in GPS data. Consequences of failing to account for measurement error are predicting overly tortuous movement, numerous returns to previously visited locations, inaccurately predicting species range, core areas, and the frequency of crossing linear features. By understanding the effect of GPS measurement error, ecologists are able to disregard false signals to more accurately design conservation plans for endangered wildlife.},

Although numerous studies have investigated the quality and accuracy of location data associated with different brands of GPS collars, none of these studies has investigated the influence of measurement error on the parameters used to create movement models. We used Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the measurement error for estimates of turning angle and step length as a function of distance between consecutive locations. We show that estimates of turning angle and step length are accurate only when the distance between two locations is large relative to the measurement error. Estimates of turning angle are particularly susceptible to error for short step lengths. The consequences of choosing poor data-collecting schedules are discussed, and suggestions for designing appropriate data-collecting schedules are provided.},

The continuous-time model was placed into a state\textendash space framework to allow parameter estimation and location predictions from observed animal locations. Two previously unpublished marine mammal telemetry data sets were analyzed to illustrate use of the model, by-products available from the analysis, and different modifications which are possible. A harbor seal data set was analyzed with a model that incorporates the proportion of each hour spent on land.

We review problems with current methods and suggest a more powerful and flexible approach, state-space modeling, and we illustrate how these models can be posed in a meta-analytic framework so that information from individual trajectories may be combined optimally. State-space models enable us to deal with the complexity of modeling animals interacting with their environment but, unlike other methods, they allow simultaneous estimation of measurement error and process noise that are inherent in animal-trajectory data. A Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate important prior information when available and also allows meta-analytic techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Meta-analysis enables both individual and broader-level inference from observations of multiple individual pathways. Our approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test hypotheses regarding animal movement, to connect theoretical models to data, and to use modern likelihood-based estimation techniques, all under a single statistical framework.},

  abstract = {Identifying the foraging habitat of marine predators is vital to understanding the ecology of these species and for their management and conservation. Foraging habitat for many marine predators is dynamic, and this poses a serious challenge for understanding how oceanographic features may shape the ecology of these animals. To help resolve this issue, we present a switching state-space model (SSSM) for discerning different movement behaviours hidden within error-prone satellite telemetry data. Along with modelling the movement dynamics, the SSSM estimates the probability that an animal is in a particular discrete behavioural mode, such as transiting or foraging. Using Argos satellite telemetry for leatherback sea turtles, we show that the SSSM readily identifies distinct classes of movement behaviour from the noisy data. Moreover, patterns in simultaneously collected diving data, to which the model is blind, match well with behavioural mode estimates. By combining behavioural mode estimates from the model with the diving data, we show that while transiting, leatherbacks make longer, deeper dives; and while foraging, they encounter cooler waters that range from 13 to 22\textdegree C. These differences are consistent among the turtles studied and within the same turtle in different years. This modelling approach can enhance standard kernel density estimators for identifying habitat use by incorporating behavioural information into the estimation procedure. Ultimately, we can build predictive models of habitat use by incorporating environmental data and diving behaviour directly into the SSSM framework.},

Recent advances in tracking technology have enabled fundamental questions about movement to be tackled, leading to the development of the movement ecology framework (MEF), considered a milestone in the field [1]. The MEF introduced an integrative theory of organismal movement, linking internal state, motion capacity and navigation capacity to external factors. Here, a decade later, we investigated the current state of research in the field. Using a text mining approach on {$>$}8000 peer-reviewed papers in movement ecology, we explored the main research topics, evaluated the impact of the MEF, and assessed changes in the use of technological devices, software and statistical methods. The number of publications has increased considerably and there have been major technological changes in the past decade (i.e.\textasciitilde increased use of GPS devices, accelerometers and video cameras, and a convergence towards R), yet we found that research focuses on the same questions, specifically, on the effect of environmental factors on movement and behavior. In practice, it appears that movement ecology research does not reflect the MEF. We call on researchers to transform the field from technology-driven to embrace interdisciplinary collaboration, in order to reveal key processes underlying movement (e.g.\textasciitilde navigation), as well as evolutionary, physiological and life-history consequences of particular strategies.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, mobile computing and wireless communication have become increasingly important drivers of many new computing applications. The field of wireless sensor networks particularly focuses on applications involving autonomous use of compute, sensing, and wireless communication devices for both scientific and commercial purposes. This paper examines the research decisions and design tradeoffs that arise when applying wireless peer-to-peer networking techniques in a mobile sensor network designed to support wildlife tracking for biology research.The ZebraNet system includes custom tracking collars (nodes) carried by animals under study across a large, wild area; the collars operate as a peer-to-peer network to deliver logged data back to researchers. The collars include global positioning system (GPS), Flash memory, wireless transceivers, and a small CPU; essentially each node is a small, wireless computing device. Since there is no cellular service or broadcast communication covering the region where animals are studied, ad hoc, peer-to-peer routing is needed. Although numerous ad hoc protocols exist, additional challenges arise because the researchers themselves are mobile and thus there is no fixed base station towards which to aim data. Overall, our goal is to use the least energy, storage, and other resources necessary to maintain a reliable system with a very high `data homing' success rate. We plan to deploy a 30-node ZebraNet system at the Mpala Research Centre in central Kenya. More broadly, we believe that the domain-centric protocols and energy tradeoffs presented here for ZebraNet will have general applicability in other wireless and sensor applications.},

Acoustic telemetry provides a valuable method within the telemetry toolbox, but has rarely been used in noisy, constrained, swift-flowing, and air-entrained environments such as fishways because of the perceived limitations of acoustic telemetry in such environments relative to other techniques such as radio telemetry. However, there have been no published studies that represent systematic evaluations of both detection efficiency based on number of transmitted signals and detection probabilities based on number of fish detected in fishways for acoustic telemetry. As such, the efficacy of acoustic telemetry in a fishway was evaluated using both controlled field experiments and movements of live fish at the Wanapum Dam fishway on the Columbia River in Washington State. In this study, the Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) was selected because of its high carrier frequency (416.7 kHz) and short signal duration yielding good system resilience in shallow, noisy, and constrained environments.},

Until relatively recently, however, such efforts were limited to short distances and times in species large enough to carry large batteries and transmitters. New technologies have opened up new frontiers in animal tracking remote data collection. Hussey et al. review the unique directions such efforts have taken for marine systems, while Kays et al. review recent advances for terrestrial species. We have entered a new era of animal ecology, where animals act as both subjects and samplers of their environments. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255642, 10.1126/science.aaa2478 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDThe movement of animals makes them fascinating but difficult study subjects. Animal movements underpin many biological phenomena, and understanding them is critical for applications in conservation, health, and food. Traditional approaches to animal tracking used field biologists wielding antennas to record a few dozen locations per animal, revealing only the most general patterns of animal space use. The advent of satellite tracking automated this process, but initially was limited to larger animals and increased the resolution of trajectories to only a few hundred locations per animal. The last few years have shown exponential improvement in tracking technology, leading to smaller tracking devices that can return millions of movement steps for ever-smaller animals. Finally, we have a tool that returns high-resolution data that reveal the detailed facets of animal movement and its many implications for biodiversity, animal ecology, behavior, and ecosystem function. ADVANCESImproved technology has brought animal tracking into the realm of big data, not only through high-resolution movement trajectories, but also through the addition of other on-animal sensors and the integration of remote sensing data about the environment through which these animals are moving. These new data are opening up a breadth of new scientific questions about ecology, evolution, and physiology and enable the use of animals as sensors of the environment. High\textendash temporal resolution movement data also can document brief but important contacts between animals, creating new opportunities to study social networks, as well as interspecific interactions such as competition and predation. With solar panels keeping batteries charged, ``lifetime'' tracks can now be collected for some species, while broader approaches are aiming for species-wide sampling across multiple populations. Miniaturized tags also help reduce the impact of the devices on the study subjects, improving animal welfare and scientific results. As in other disciplines, the explosion of data volume and variety has created new challenges and opportunities for information management, integration, and analysis. In an exciting interdisciplinary push, biologists, statisticians, and computer scientists have begun to develop new tools that are already leading to new insights and scientific breakthroughs. OUTLOOKWe suggest that a golden age of animal tracking science has begun and that the upcoming years will be a time of unprecedented exciting discoveries. Technology continues to improve our ability to track animals, with the promise of smaller tags collecting more data, less invasively, on a greater variety of animals. The big-data tracking studies that are just now being pioneered will become commonplace. If analytical developments can keep pace, the field will be able to develop real-time predictive models that integrate habitat preferences, movement abilities, sensory capacities, and animal memories into movement forecasts. The unique perspective offered by big-data animal tracking enables a new view of animals as naturally evolved sensors of environment, which we think has the potential to help us monitor the planet in completely new ways. A massive multi-individual monitoring program would allow a quorum sensing of our planet, using a variety of species to tap into the diversity of senses that have evolved across animal groups, providing new insight on our world through the sixth sense of the global animal collective. We expect that the field will soon reach a transformational point where these studies do more than inform us about particular species of animals, but allow the animals to teach us about the world. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/348/6240/aaa2478/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Big-data animal tracking.The red trajectory shows how studies can now track animals with unprecedented detail, allowing researchers to predict the causes and consequences of movements, and animals to become environmental sensors. Multisensor tracking tags monitor movement, behavior, physiology, and environmental context. Geo- and biosciences merge now using a multitude of remote-sensing data. Understanding how social and interspecific interactions affect movement is the next big frontier. Moving animals connect our world, spreading pollen, seeds, nutrients, and parasites as they go about the their daily lives. Recent integration of high-resolution Global Positioning System and other sensors into miniaturized tracking tags has dramatically improved our ability to describe animal movement. This has created opportunities and challenges that parallel big data transformations in other fields and has rapidly advanced animal ecology and physiology. New analytical approaches, combined with remotely sensed or modeled environmental information, have opened up a host of new questions on the causes of movement and its consequences for individuals, populations, and ecosystems. Simultaneous tracking of multiple animals is leading to new insights on species interactions and, scaled up, may enable distributed monitoring of both animals and our changing environment.},

  abstract = {1 Global positioning system (GPS) technology enables researchers to evaluate wildlife movements, space use and resource selection in detail for extended periods of time. Two types of errors, missed location fixes and location error, are inherent to GPS telemetry and can bias location data sets. Habitat characteristics can influence both types of errors, but no studies have reported how continuous ranges of canopy cover and terrain simultaneously affect location error at different positional dilution of precision (PDOP) and signal quality levels. This information can assist in developing a protocol for removing large location errors from GPS data sets. 2 The objectives of this study were to quantify how canopy cover and terrain affected GPS collar performance within a mountainous region of northern Idaho, USA, and evaluate different data-screening options for GPS location data sets from stationary test collars and free-ranging black bears Ursus americanus. 3 The fix rate for test collars was very high in all habitats (mean 99{$\cdot$}5\%, SE 0{$\cdot$}14, range 97{$\cdot$}9\textendash 100\%) and was not related to canopy cover or terrain obstruction. However, habitat variables strongly influenced location error, PDOP values and proportion of three-dimensional (3-D) fixes. The 95\% circular error probable (CEP) equalled 106{$\cdot$}8 m for locations at all test sites, and varied substantially with canopy cover, terrain obstruction and signal quality categories, ranging from 14{$\cdot$}3 m to 557{$\cdot$}0 m. Location errors for two-dimensional (2-D) fixes were more variable at higher PDOP values and were significantly larger compared with 3-D fixes. 4 Data screening increased the accuracy of test collar location data sets by removing large location errors that were associated with high PDOP values. Data-screening options that focused on screening 2-D locations were most effective in reducing location error and retaining the greatest number of locations. For black bear data sets, the four data screening options resulted in data reduction ranging from 8\% to 35\%. 5 Synthesis and applications. We have demonstrated how location data can be analysed and screened based on 2-D and 3-D fixes in relation to PDOP values to eliminate locations with potentially large location errors. This information can be applied to GPS location data for individual animals to increase data accuracy for analyses.},

The Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) was developed to observe the out-migratory behavior of juvenile salmonids tagged by surgical implantation of acoustic micro-transmitters and to estimate the survival when passing through dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. A robust three-dimensional solver was needed to accurately and efficiently estimate the time sequence of locations of fish tagged with JSATS acoustic transmitters, to describe in sufficient detail the information needed to assess the function of dam-passage design alternatives. An approximate maximum likelihood solver was developed using measurements of time difference of arrival from all hydrophones in receiving arrays on which a transmission was detected. Field experiments demonstrated that the developed solver performed significantly better in tracking efficiency and accuracy than other solvers described in the literature.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in animal tracking technology have permitted the collection of detailed data on the movement paths of individuals from many species. However, analysis methods for these data have not developed at a similar pace, largely due to a lack of suitable candidate models, coupled with the technical difficulties of fitting such models to data. To facilitate a general modeling framework, we propose that complex movement paths can be conceived as a series of movement strategies among which animals transition as they are affected by changes in their internal and external environment. We synthesize previously existing and novel methodologies to develop a general suite of mechanistic models based on biased and correlated random walks that allow different behavioral states for directed (e.g., migration), exploratory (e.g., dispersal), area-restricted (e.g., foraging), and other types of movement. Using this ``toolbox'' of nested model components, multistate movement models may be custom-built for a wide variety of species and applications. As a unified state-space modeling framework, it allows the simultaneous investigation of numerous hypotheses about animal movement from imperfectly observed data, including time allocations to different movement behavior states, transitions between states, the use of memory or navigation, and strengths of attraction (or repulsion) to specific locations. The inclusion of covariate information permits further investigation of specific hypotheses related to factors driving different types of movement behavior. Using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to facilitate Bayesian model selection and multi-model inference, we apply the proposed methodology to real data by adapting it to the natural history of the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) in the North Sea. Although previous grey seal studies tended to focus on correlated movements, we found overwhelming evidence that bias toward haul-out or foraging locations better explained seal movement than did simple or correlated random walks. Posterior model probabilities also provided evidence that seals transition among directed, area-restricted, and exploratory movements associated with haul-out, foraging, and other behaviors. With this intuitive framework for modeling and interpreting animal movement, we believe that the development and application of custom-made movement models will become more accessible to ecologists and non-statisticians.},

  abstract = {The Argos satellite telemetry system is popular for studying the movement and space use of marine animals. The life histories of marine mammals, in particular, result in a relatively large proportion of inaccurate locations, thus making analysis methods that do not account for location measurement error inappropriate for these data. Using a new Kalman filtering algorithm, Argos now provides locations and estimated error ellipses associated with each satellite fix, but to our knowledge, the location error ellipse has yet to be incorporated into analyses of animal movement or space use. We first present an observation model utilizing the Argos error ellipse and then demonstrate how this observation model can be combined with a simple three-dimensional movement model in a state-space formulation to infer activity budgets and movement characteristics from location and dive data of two species of seal, the bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) and the Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi). These example data sets are of variable quality and represent species that differ in both space use and latitudinal range relative to the polar orbits of Argos satellites. We also compare the results from our error ellipse model with those from an approximate (isotropic) error circle model. We found the error circle to be a crude approximation of the actual anisotropic error ellipse for the higher quality bearded seal data, but inferences from the lower quality Hawaiian monk seal data were more robust to the choice of observation model. In both examples, we found the theoretical bivariate normal distribution corresponding to the error ellipse often failed to adequately explain the most extreme location outliers. In practice, we suspect the inferential consequences of using traditional isotropic location quality classes or other crude approximations in lieu of the error ellipse will be largely case-dependent. We support the Argos recommendation that practitioners wishing to more properly account for location measurement error utilize the error ellipse in analyses. However, the continued presence of outliers using the new algorithm suggests practitioners should consider using a fat-tailed distribution derived from the error ellipse (e.g. bivariate t-distribution) or filtering extreme outliers during data pre-processing.},

A four-step filtering approach which incorporates data-filtering principles developed for GPS tracking of terrestrial animals is demonstrated. HPE was evaluated for its effectiveness to remove uncertain fish positions acquired from a new underwater fine-scale passive acoustic monitoring system.},

This has led to a huge demand for statistical tools that allow ecologists to draw meaningful inference from large tracking data sets. The class of hidden Markov models (HMMs) matches the intuitive understanding that animal movement is driven by underlying behavioural modes and has proven to be very useful for analysing movement data. For data that involve a regular sampling unit and negligible measurement error, these models usually are sufficiently flexible to capture the complex correlation structure found in movement data, yet are computationally inexpensive compared to alternative methods. The R package moveHMM allows ecologists to process GPS tracking data into series of step lengths and turning angles, and to fit an HMM to these data, allowing, in particular, for the incorporation of environmental covariates. The package includes assessment and visualization tools for the fitted model. We illustrate the use of moveHMM using (simulated) movement of the legendary wild haggis Haggis scoticus. Our findings illustrate the role our software, and movement modelling in general, can play in conservation and management by illuminating environmental constraints.},

  abstract = {Continuous-time models have been developed to capture features of animal movement across temporal scales. In particular, one popular model is the continuous-time correlated random walk, in which the velocity of an animal is formulated as an Ornstein\textendash Uhlenbeck process, to capture the autocorrelation in the speed and direction of its movement. In telemetry analyses, discrete-time state-switching models (such as hidden Markov models) have been increasingly popular to identify behavioural phases from animal tracking data. We propose a multistate formulation of the continuous-time correlated random walk, with an underlying Markov process used as a proxy for the animal's behavioural state process. We present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to carry out Bayesian inference for this multistate continuous-time model. Posterior samples of the hidden state sequence, of the state transition rates, and of the state-dependent movement parameters can be obtained. We investigate the performance of the method in a simulation study, and we illustrate its use in a case study of grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) tracking data. The method we present makes use of the state-space model formulation of the continuous-time correlated random walk, and can accommodate irregular sampling frequency and measurement error. It will facilitate the use of continuous-time models to estimate movement characteristics and infer behavioural states from animal telemetry data.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are frequently used to understand the influence of site properties on species occurrence. For robust model inference, SDMs need to account for the spatial autocorrelation of virtually all species occurrence data. Current methods do not routinely distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of spatial autocorrelation, although these may have different implications for conservation. Here, we present and test a method that disentangles extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of spatial autocorrelation using repeated observations of a species. We focus on unknown habitat characteristics and conspecific interactions as extrinsic and intrinsic drivers, respectively. We model the former with spatially correlated random effects and the latter with an autocovariate, such that the spatially correlated random effects are constant across the repeated observations whereas the autocovariate may change. We tested the performance of our model on virtual species data and applied it to observations of the corncrake Crex crex in the Netherlands. Applying our model to virtual species data revealed that it was well able to distinguish between the two different drivers of spatial autocorrelation, outperforming models with no or a single component for spatial autocorrelation. This finding was independent of the direction of the conspecific interactions (i.e. conspecific attraction versus competitive exclusion). The simulations confirmed that the ability of our model to disentangle both drivers of autocorrelation depends on repeated observations. In the case study, we discovered that the corncrake has a stronger response to habitat characteristics compared to a model that did not include spatially correlated random effects, whereas conspecific interactions appeared to be less important. This implies that future conservation efforts should primarily focus on maximizing habitat availability. Our study shows how to systematically disentangle extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of spatial autocorrelation. The method we propose can help to correctly identify the main drivers of species distributions.},

Each step and turn is assigned to one of a number of random walks, each characteristic of a different behavioral state. Behavioral state assignments may be inferred purely from movement data or may include the habitat type in which the animals are located. Switching between different behavioral states may be modeled explicitly using a state transition matrix estimated directly from data, or switching probabilities may take into account the proximity of animals to landscape features. Model fitting is undertaken within a Bayesian framework using the WinBUGS software. These methods allow for identification of different movement states using several properties of observed paths and lead naturally to the formulation of movement models. Analysis of relocation data from elk released in east-central Ontario, Canada, suggests a biphasic movement behavior: elk are either in an ``encamped'' state in which step lengths are small and turning angles are high, or in an ``exploratory'' state, in which daily step lengths are several kilometers and turning angles are small. Animals encamp in open habitat (agricultural fields and opened forest), but the exploratory state is not associated with any particular habitat type.},

  abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

However, similarity between conspecific strategies may also result from similar resource environments. Here, we revisit classic predictions of the relationships between the resource distribution and foragers' space use by tracking free-living foragers of a single species in two contrasting resource landscapes. At two main non-breeding areas along the East-Atlantic flyway (Wadden Sea, The Netherlands and Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania), we mapped prey distributions and derived resource landscapes in terms of the predicted intake rate of red knots (Calidris canutus), migratory molluscivore shorebirds. We tracked the foraging paths of 13 and 38 individual red knots at intervals of 1\,s over two and five weeks in the Wadden Sea and at Banc d'Arguin, respectively. Mediated by competition for resources, we expected aggregation to be strong and site fidelity weak in an environment with large resource patches. The opposite was expected for small resource patches, but only if local resource abundances were high. Compared with Banc d'Arguin, resource patches in the Wadden Sea were larger and the maximum local resource abundance was higher. However, because of constraints set by digestive capacity, the average potential intake rates by red knots were similar at the two study sites. Space-use patterns differed as predicted from these differences in resource landscapes. Whereas foraging red knots in the Wadden Sea roamed the mudflats in high aggregation without site fidelity (i.e. grouping nomads), at Banc d'Arguin they showed less aggregation but were strongly site-faithful (i.e. solitary residents). The space use pattern of red knots in the two study areas showed diametrically opposite patterns. These differences could be explained from the distribution of resources in the two areas. Our findings imply that intraspecific similarities in space use patterns represent responses to similar resource environments rather than species-specificity. To predict how environmental change affects space use, we need to understand the degree to which space-use strategies result from developmental plasticity and behavioural flexibility. This requires not only tracking foragers throughout their development, but also tracking their environment in sufficient spatial and temporal detail.},

Such multilevel societies, where stable groups move together through the landscape, overlapping and associating preferentially with specific other groups, are thought to represent one of the most complex forms of social structure in vertebrates. For example, hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) live in units consisting of one male and one or several females, or of several solitary males, that group into clans. These clans then come together with solitary bachelor males to form larger bands [2]. This social structure means that individuals have to track many different types of relationships at the same time [1,3]. Here, we provide detailed quantitative evidence for the presence of a multilevel society in a small-brained bird, the vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum). We demonstrate that this species lives in large, multi-male, multi-female groups that associate preferentially with specific other groups, both during the day and at night-time communal roosts.},

It is now possible to record time series of animal locations and ancillary data (e.g. activity level derived from on-board accelerometers) over extended areas and long durations with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Such time series are often piecewise stationary, as the animal may alternate between different stationary phases (i.e. characterized by a specific mean and variance of some key parameter for limited periods). Identifying when these phases start and end is a critical first step to understand the dynamics of the underlying movement processes. We introduce a new segmentation-clustering method we called segclust2d (available as a r package at cran.r-project.org/package=segclust2d). It can segment bivariate (or more generally multivariate) time series and possibly cluster the various segments obtained, corresponding to different phases assumed to be stationary. This method is easy to use, as it only requires specifying a minimum segment length (to prevent over-segmentation), based on biological rather than statistical considerations. This method can be applied to bivariate piecewise time series of any nature. We focus here on two types of time series related to animal movement, corresponding to (a) at large scale, series of bivariate coordinates of relocations, to highlight temporary home ranges, and (b) at smaller scale, bivariate series derived from relocations data, such as speed and turning angle, to highlight different behavioural modes such as transit, feeding and resting. Using computer simulations, we show that segclust2d can rival and even outperform previous, more complex methods, which were specifically developed to highlight changes of movement modes or home range shifts (based on hidden Markov and Ornstein\textendash Uhlenbeck modelling), which, contrary to our method, usually require the user to provide relevant initial guesses to be efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate it on actual examples involving a zebra's small-scale movements and an elephant's large-scale movements, to illustrate how various movement modes and home range shifts, respectively, can be identified.},

  abstract = {Global navigation satellite systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) is one of the most important sensors for movement analysis. GPS is widely used to record the trajectories of vehicles, animals and human beings. However, all GPS movement data are affected by both measurement and interpolation errors. In this article we show that measurement error causes a systematic bias in distances recorded with a GPS; the distance between two points recorded with a GPS is \textendash{} on average \textendash{} bigger than the true distance between these points. This systematic `overestimation of distance' becomes relevant if the influence of interpolation error can be neglected, which in practice is the case for movement sampled at high frequencies. We provide a mathematical explanation of this phenomenon and illustrate that it functionally depends on the autocorrelation of GPS measurement error (C). We argue that C can be interpreted as a quality measure for movement data recorded with a GPS. If there is a strong autocorrelation between any two consecutive position estimates, they have very similar error. This error cancels out when average speed, distance or direction is calculated along the trajectory. Based on our theoretical findings we introduce a novel approach to determine C in real-world GPS movement data sampled at high frequencies. We apply our approach to pedestrian trajectories and car trajectories. We found that the measurement error in the data was strongly spatially and temporally autocorrelated and give a quality estimate of the data. Most importantly, our findings are not limited to GPS alone. The systematic bias and its implications are bound to occur in any movement data collected with absolute positioning if interpolation error can be neglected.},

  abstract = {Radiotracking is an important and often the only possible method to explore specific habits and the behaviour of animals, but it has proven to be very demanding and time-consuming, especially when frequent positioning of a large group is required. Our aim was to address this issue by making the process partially automated, to mitigate the demands and related costs. This paper presents a novel automated tracking system that consists of a network of automated tracking stations deployed within the target area. Each station reads the signals from telemetry transmitters, estimates the bearing and distance of the tagged animals and records their position. The station is capable of tracking a theoretically unlimited number of transmitters on different frequency channels with the period of 5\textendash 15 seconds per single channel. An ordinary transmitter that fits within the supported frequency band might be used with BAARA (Biological AutomAted RAdiotracking); an extra option is the use of a custom-programmable transmitter with configurable operational parameters, such as the precise frequency channel or the transmission parameters. This new approach to a tracking system was tested for its applicability in a series of field and laboratory tests. BAARA has been tested within fieldwork explorations of Rousettus aegyptiacus during field trips to Dakhla oasis in Egypt. The results illustrate the novel perspective which automated radiotracking opens for the study of spatial behaviour, particularly in addressing topics in the domain of population ecology.},

Rapid advances in technology are allowing scientists to use data-recording units to acquire huge, quantitative datasets of behavior from animals moving freely in their natural environment. In other words, scientists can examine wild animals in the field, behaving normally, with the same rigor that is normally used in the laboratory. The flexibility of such recording systems means that bio-logging science operates at the interface of several biological disciplines, looking at a wide array of aquatic, airborne, and terrestrial species, monitoring not only the physical characteristics of the environment, but also the animal's reactions to it. This approach is critically important in an era when global change threatens the survival of species and where habitat loss is leading to widespread extinctions.},

Bayesian filters and statistical models allow for objective trajectory estimates and inference on movement rates. As an alternative to Monte-Carlo methods, we investigate here how classic time series technique, such as the Kalman Filter, can be made robust to uncover patterns in the data. Our approach relies on a composite measurement model to account for outliers, and makes use of all the Location Classes to smooth observations and regularize the track to a regular time grid. Two application examples are presented. Using data from freely-swimming leatherback turtles, we confirm that locations of class A (LCA) are more accurate on average than class 0, and we recommend their use in tracking studies. We further show how measurement errors (and their geometry) interact with the assumed movement model, further modulating the final location error and the discriminating ability of the filter. The choice of the movement model appears important, since a model with no velocity constraint may fit observational errors at the expense of trajectory smoothness, while a speed-based model is better behaved but less forgiving for data fitting and outlier identification. Varying sea surface temperatures also appear to degrade the quality of locations and increase the occurrence of outliers, possibly in relation to thermal stratification and depth behavior. These results have important implications when inferring changes in behavior from long-term movements.},

While Fastloc GPS gives more accurate locations than earlier methods, it remains important to identify and remove locations with high error because some location fixes are much less accurate than others. Increasing the number of source satellites required for a valid fix is a simple filter method but it comes at the cost of great data loss. Using data sets acquired from loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta, we explored an alternative filtering approach, based on speed between successive locations, angles created by 3 consecutive locations, manufacturer's quality index, and number of satellites used for location calculation. The performance of the proposed filter method was evaluated by conducting terrestrial, mobile tests. When our filter method was used, the linear error (mean {$\pm$} SD) of Fastloc GPS data decreased from 2645.5 {$\pm$} 29458.2 m (n = 1328) to 47.1 {$\pm$} 61.0 m (n = 1246), while retaining more than 94\% of data. Our filter method also led to more accurate home range estimates than the simple filter method. Improvements in data retention and home range estimates will give more reliable information for marine spatial planning and habitat protection.},

  abstract = {Habitat-selection analyses are often used to link environmental covariates, measured within some spatial domain of assumed availability, to animal location data that are assumed to be independent. Step-selection functions (SSFs) relax this independence assumption, by using a conditional model that explicitly acknowledges the spatiotemporal dynamics of the availability domain and hence the temporal dependence among successive locations. However, it is not clear how to produce an SSF-based map of the expected utilization distribution. Here, we used SSFs to analyze virtual animal movement data generated at a fine spatiotemporal scale and then rarefied to emulate realistic telemetry data. We then compared two different approaches for generating maps from the estimated regression coefficients. First, we considered a na\"ive approach that used the coefficients as if they were obtained by fitting an unconditional model. Second, we explored a simulation-based approach, where maps were generated using stochastic simulations of the parameterized step-selection process. We found that the simulation-based approach always outperformed the na\"ive mapping approach and that the latter overestimated home-range size and underestimated local space-use variability. Differences between the approaches were greatest for complex landscapes and high sampling rates, suggesting that the simulation-based approach, despite its added complexity, is likely to offer significant advantages when applying SSFs to real data.},

Step-selection functions (SSFs) are commonly used to link environmental covariates to animal location data collected at fine temporal resolution. SSFs are estimated by comparing observed steps connecting successive animal locations to random steps, using a likelihood equivalent of a Cox proportional hazards model. By using common statistical distributions to model step length and turn angle distributions, and including habitat- and movement-related covariates (functions of distances between points, angular deviations), it is possible to make inference regarding habitat selection and movement processes or to control one process while investigating the other. The fitted model can also be used to estimate utilization distributions and mechanistic home ranges. Here, we present the R package amt (animal movement tools) that allows users to fit SSFs to data and to simulate space use of animals from fitted models. The amt package also provides tools for managing telemetry data. Using fisher (Pekania pennanti) data as a case study, we illustrate a four-step approach to the analysis of animal movement data, consisting of data management, exploratory data analysis, fitting of models, and simulating from fitted models.},

Data from GPS loggers are increasingly important for this. These data need to be processed, segmented and summarised for further visual and statistical analysis, often using predefined parameters. Usually, this process is separate from the subsequent visual and statistical analysis, making it difficult for these results to inform the data processing and to help set appropriate scale and thresholds parameters. This paper explores the use of highly interactive visual analytics techniques to close the gap between processing raw data and exploratory visual analysis. Working closely with animal movement ecologists, we produced requirements to enable data characteristics to be determined, initial research questions to be investigated, and the suitability of data for further analysis to be assessed. We design visual encodings and interactions to meet these requirements and provide software that implements them. We demonstrate these techniques with indicative research questions for a number of bird species, provide software, and discuss wider implications for animal movement ecology.},

Evidence collected from schooling animals suggests that the process is somewhat democratic, with nearest neighbors and the majority shaping overall collective behavior. In animals with hierarchical social structures such as primates or wolves, however, such democracy may be complicated by dominance. Strandburg-Peshkin et al. monitored all the individuals within a baboon troop continuously over the course of their daily activities. Even within this highly socially structured species, movement decisions emerged via a shared process. Thus, democracy may be an inherent trait of collective behavior. Science, this issue p. 1358 Conflicts of interest about where to go and what to do are a primary challenge of group living. However, it remains unclear how consensus is achieved in stable groups with stratified social relationships. Tracking wild baboons with a high-resolution global positioning system and analyzing their movements relative to one another reveals that a process of shared decision-making governs baboon movement. Rather than preferentially following dominant individuals, baboons are more likely to follow when multiple initiators agree. When conflicts arise over the direction of movement, baboons choose one direction over the other when the angle between them is large, but they compromise if it is not. These results are consistent with models of collective motion, suggesting that democratic collective action emerging from simple rules is widespread, even in complex, socially stratified societies. Democracy guides group decisions in baboons, even in the presence of strong social hierarchies. Democracy guides group decisions in baboons, even in the presence of strong social hierarchies.},

  abstract = {Knowing their way around The presence of a cognitive map is essential to our ability to navigate through areas we know because it facilitates the use of spatial knowledge to derive new routes. Whether such maps exist in nonhuman animals has been debated, largely because of the difficulty of demonstrating qualifying components of the map outside of a laboratory. In two studies on Egyptian fruit bats, Harten et al. and Toledo et al. together show that this species's navigational strategies meet the requirements for the use of a cognitive map of their environment, confirming that this skill occurs outside of humans (see the Perspective by Fenton). Science, this issue p. 194, p. 188; see also p. 142 Seven decades of research on the ``cognitive map,'' the allocentric representation of space, have yielded key neurobiological insights, yet field evidence from free-ranging wild animals is still lacking. Using a system capable of tracking dozens of animals simultaneously at high accuracy and resolution, we assembled a large dataset of 172 foraging Egyptian fruit bats comprising {$>$}18 million localizations collected over 3449 bat-nights across 4 years. Detailed track analysis, combined with translocation experiments and exhaustive mapping of fruit trees, revealed that wild bats seldom exhibit random search but instead repeatedly forage in goal-directed, long, and straight flights that include frequent shortcuts. Alternative, non\textendash map-based strategies were ruled out by simulations, time-lag embedding, and other trajectory analyses. Our results are consistent with expectations from cognitive map\textendash like navigation and support previous neurobiological evidence from captive bats. Egyptian fruit bats appear to use a cognitive map. Egyptian fruit bats appear to use a cognitive map.},

  abstract = {Besides the ``normal'' challenge of obtaining adequate intake rates in a patchy and dangerous world, shorebirds foraging in intertidal habitats face additional environmental hurdles. The tide forces them to commute between a roosting site and feeding grounds, twice a day. Moreover, because intertidal food patches are not all available at the same time, shorebirds should follow itineraries along the best patches available at a given time. Finally, shorebirds need additional energy stores in order to survive unpredictable periods of bad weather, during which food patches are covered by extreme tides. In order to model such tide-specific decisions, we applied stochastic dynamic programming in a spatially explicit context. Two assumptions were varied, leading to four models. First, birds had either perfect (ideal) or no (non-ideal) information about the intake rate at each site. Second, traveling between sites was either for free or incurred time and energy costs (non-free). Predictions were generated for three aspects of foraging: area use, foraging routines, and energy stores. In general, non-ideal foragers should feed most intensely and should maintain low energy stores. If traveling for such birds is free, they should feed at a random site; otherwise, they should feed close to their roost. Ideal foragers should concentrate their feeding around low tide (especially when free) and should maintain larger energy stores (especially when non-free). If traveling for such birds is free, they should feed at the site offering the highest intake rate; otherwise, they should trade off travel costs and intake rate. Models were parameterized for Red Knots (Calidris canutus) living in the Dutch Wadden Sea in late summer, an area for which detailed, spatially explicit data on prey densities and tidal heights are available. Observations of radio-marked knots (area use) and unmarked knots (foraging routines, energy stores) showed the closest match with the ideal/non-free model. We conclude that knots make state-dependent decisions by trading off starvation against foraging-associated risks, including predation. Presumably, knots share public information about resource quality that enables them to behave in a more or less ideal manner. We suggest that our modeling approach may be applicable in other systems where resources fluctuate in space and time.},

  abstract = {Advances in technology have allowed ecologists to employ remote observations of individual organism's spatial location. These data are used to model species distributions and habitat associations, which inform conservation efforts and management plans. These data are not without error. To illustrate the consequences of not considering measurement error, I introduce measurement error to a habitat selection model, using three different distributions. I show how measurement error can confound inferences made about a hypothetical organism's true habitat selection. By simulating different initial strengths of selection I show the introduction of measurement error results in the largest reduction in habitat selection strength (from truth) for very selective individuals (habitat specialists). Not surprisingly, the inclusion of error in very weakly selective individuals (habitat generalists) can result in a switching from true selection to observed avoidance. Researchers need to be aware that, first, there is measurement error in remotely observed data, and second, a tradeoff occurs between measurement error and landscape fragmentation. Landscapes with a high degree of fragmentation require spatially accurate (low measurement error) data in order to make reliable estimates of habitat selection or species distribution. The results of this study are discussed in light of the conservation of species threatened by habitat fragmentation and the management suggestions arising from selection studies.},

We describe the system in detail and show that it produces accurate location estimates in real settings and over long periods of time. Localization errors of wild animals carrying our transmitters have standard deviation of about 5m and mean of 5-15m. If we restrict the system to operate in the center of the receiver's band-pass filters, the mean error drops to about 5m. We also show how to reliably quantify the error in each individual location estimate. In addition to the characterization of accuracy, we introduce three technical innovations in the system. First, a method to model the error of individual time-of- arrival measurements, enabling correct weighing of the data to estimate locations and allowing estimation of the covariance matrix of each location estimate. Second, extensive use of known- position beacon transmitters, to synchronize the clocks of receivers (radio-frequency TOA localization require accurate clocks), to characterize and continuously monitor the performance of the system, and to model arrival- time-estimation errors. Third, we estimate the covariance matrix of each localization.},

  abstract = {Measurement of the time allocation of penguins at sea has been a major goal of researchers in recent years. Until now, however, no equipment has been available that would allow measurement of the aquatic and terrestrial behaviour of an Antarctic penguin while it is commuting between the colony and the foraging grounds. A new motion detector, based on the measurement of acceleration, has been used here in addition to current methods of inferring behaviour using data loggers that monitor depth and speed. We present data on the time allocation of Ad\'elie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) according to the different types of behaviours they display during their foraging trips: walking, tobogganing, standing on land, lying on land, resting at the water surface, porpoising and diving. To illustrate the potential of this new technique, we compared the behaviour of Ad\'elie penguins during the chick-rearing period in a fast sea-ice region and an ice-free region. The proportion of time spent standing, lying on land and walking during foraging trips was greater for penguins in the sea-ice region (37.6+/-13.3\% standing, 21.6+/-15.6\% lying and 5.9+/-6.3\% walking) than for those in the ice-free region (12.0+/-15.8 \% standing, 0.38+/-0.60\% lying and 0 \% walking), whereas the proportion of time spent resting at the water surface and porpoising was greater for birds in the ice-free region (38.1+/-6.4\% resting and 1.1+/-1.1\% porpoising) than for those in the sea-ice region (3.0+/-2.3\% resting and 0\% porpoising; means +/- s.d., N=7 for the sea-ice region, N=4 for the ice-free region). Using this new approach, further studies combining the monitoring of marine resources in different Antarctic sites and the measurement of the energy expenditure of foraging penguins, e.g. using heart rates, will constitute a powerful tool for investigating the effects of environmental conditions on their foraging strategy. This technique will expand our ability to monitor many animals in the field.},

In particular, it focuses on lateration approaches, which use time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements to estimate range or pseudorange. The chapter presents the basic approaches to each as well as geometric interpretations of the approaches. Also, due to the fact that lateration involves inherently nonlinear functions, it discusses linearization techniques, which ease the computational requirements at the expense of accuracy. The chapter examines the impact of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, a major impediment in lateration-based positioning. In TOA-based position location systems deployed in dense multipath propagation environments, especially indoors or in urban scenarios, the line-of-sight (LOS) path between nodes may be obstructed. As a result, in NLOS conditions, TOA-based range estimates are positively biased with high probability since the first arriving multipath component travels a distance that is in excess of the true LOS distance.},
